# Development Process

This document explains the step-by-step process followed while building the static portfolio website.

## 1. Planning the Website

Before starting the coding work, I planned the overall website structure:
- Identified required sections: Hero, About, Skills, Projects, Contact, Footer
- Decided to use a dark theme with simple contrasting accent colors
- Sketched a rough wireframe layout for desktop and mobile views
- Set up the folder structure:

## 2. Building the HTML Structure

- Created `index.html` and added necessary semantic tags:
- `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`
- Inserted headings, paragraphs, buttons, and placeholders for images
- Added internal navigation links using `href="#section-id"`

The HTML was kept clean and readable to make future edits easier.

## 3. Styling with CSS

Created a `styles.css` file and developed the layout step-by-step:

### Layout Techniques Used:
- **Flexbox** for the header, hero section alignment, and horizontal groups
- **CSS Grid** for skills and projects section
- **Media queries** for screens below 850px
- **Minimal hover effects** for buttons and project cards
- **Simple transitions** to make the design more interactive
- **Dark theme** using simple background colors and accent highlight color

The CSS was written at a mid-level complexity: clean, functional, and not overly advanced.

## 4. Making the Site Responsive

- Created breakpoints for mobile screens
- Stacked hero text and profile image on small screens
- Adjusted grid columns to 1 or 2 depending on screen width
- Hid navigation bar on small screens (simple approach)

## 5. Testing

- Viewed the site in Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge
- Tested responsive layout at multiple screen sizes
- Fixed spacing issues, alignment, and text readability

## 6. Final Improvements

After testing, minor refinements were made:
- Improved spacing between sections
- Adjusted colors for better contrast
- Simplified hover animations
